<h1>Description</h1>
<pre>Now since I don't want to cause any more-boiling of the pot as their is over this theory of "subbotting", I"ve done some digging of my own looking into the MySQL database of submenow, there were 2 purchases for "<a href="https://twitter.com/LeafyIsHere">LeafyIsHere</a>"'s youtube channel yes, but there were also multiple for "<a href="https://twitter.com/keemstar">Keemstar</a>" also.
So the fact there are multiple events of purchases doesn't say alot, I looked into the logs of WHOM was botting, apparently it doesn't require you to log in via Google Auth2 due to the fact there we different emails used from different IPs.</pre>

<h1>Conclussion</h1>
<pre>
There simply isn't enough data when it comes down to it, see here's the facts:
- There MySQL doesn't log whom did what exactly, it just uses their account while they're logged in to kinda do what <b>zombie</b> or <b>phantomjs</b> does, just emulating inputs to subscribe.
