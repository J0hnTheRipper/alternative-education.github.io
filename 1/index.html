	<h1>Description</h1>
	<pre>Now since I don't want to cause any more-boiling of the pot as their is over this theory of "subbotting", I"ve done some digging of my own looking into the MYSQL database of submenow, there were 2 purchases for "LeafyIsHere"'s youtube channel yes, but there were also multiple for "Keemstar" also. So the fact there are multiple events of purchases doesn't say alot, I looked into the logs of WHOM purchased, apparently it doesn't require you to log in via Google Auth2 due to the fact there we different emails used from different IPs.</pre>
